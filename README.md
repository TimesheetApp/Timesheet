# Timesheet Approval Workflow

This application allows an employer to track the hours worked by their employees. The application allows users (Employees) to register for new accounts. 

# Users [Employees]
Once the users are logged in they can: 
  - Complete a timesheet form. 
  - Enter multiple pay codes for each day. 
  - Specify the hours (start and end time) for each pay code. 
  - Save and go back to edit their timesheet at any time before submission. 
  - Users will receive a confirmation email once they submit a timesheet.
  - If the timesheet has not been approved users can edit their timesheet.  
  - If the timesheet gets rejected, the user will receive an email with a reason and the user can edit their timesheet again. 
  
  
# Admin [Supervisors]
Once the Admin or supervisor logs in they can:
  - Approve or reject a timesheet. 
  - If the admin decides to reject a timesheet, a textbox will be provided where a reason for rejection can be sent to the employee's email.
  - After approval, a pay stub with the employee's information and gross earning for that period will be generated. 
  - Supervisors can generate a list of unapproved, approved or rejected timesheets. 
  - Admin will receive a Request for Action email once an employee submits a timesheet. 

# Timesheet

- The timesheet will display current stage, date, hours worked by the employee and 
- Users can Create/Edit/Save the timesheet.
